# Parking Lot Occupancy Counter
The primary task of this lab was to design and simulate a parking lot occupancy counter and be able to demonstrate the program on a DE1_SoC FPGA board.
Consider a parking lot with a single entry and exit gate. The two pairs of photo sensors are used to monitor the activity of the cars. For instance, when an object is between the photo transmitter and the photo receiver, the light is blocked, and the corresponding output is asserted to 1. By monitoring the events of two sensors, we can determine whether a car is entering or exiting, or a pedestrian is passing through. 
The following design will be implemented on the FPGA using KEY inputs to trigger the two sensors, initializing the parking lot counter to increment. Assuming that the maximum capacity of the parking lot is 25 spots, the HEX displays will display the number of cars currently in the parking lot until it reaches a max capacity of 25, when it displays FULL. If the parking lot is empty, the HEX displays illustrate the word "ENPTY" (or empty since an M can't be really written on one full HEX).
